## BDD

Test project utilizing the Lumen PHP Framework for my BDD talks.

Simplified Usage With Vagrant Box
---------------------------------

I've built a Vagrant box based on the scotch-io/scotch-box Vagrant box to use as ready-to-run, works-out-of-the-box environment for my example code.

To use it, follow the instructions in the [joshuaswarren/bdd-box](https://github.com/joshuaswarren/bdd-box) [README](https://github.com/joshuaswarren/bdd-box/blob/master/README.md).
